### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
  ðŸ˜„Welcome to apply for DataCap at https://ehume.com/#/DC
  
  ðŸ“«Slack: @Ehume
  
  
  ðŸ‘¯Supporting Scope

- Clients with open dataset (research/non-profit), open commercial/enterprise, private commercial/enterprise, private non-profit/social impact can apply datacap from our allocator pathway

ðŸ”­Requirement of clients
1. Clients need to submit datacap application to our repo (https://github.com/Ehume/Ehume/issues)
2. Clients are required to pay a pledge (pledge refunded while cid report is compliant)
3. Client's dataset is required to store at least 5 copies
4. After the client completes the storage, the client needs to inform allocator on the application

ðŸŒ±Step of application
1. Clients need to use their github account to (https://github.com/Ehume/Ehume/issues) to submit a datacap application, which will be reviewed by allocator
2. Once the application is approved, client needs to go to https://www.ehume.com/#/DC to pay the pledge. After completing the pledging, client can receive datacap
3. Clients use datacap for data storage
4. Within ten business days, allocator will check the client's cid report and return the pledge after confirming they are eilgible; if the client is not compliant, the pledge will be transferred to sp to cover the cost of storage
